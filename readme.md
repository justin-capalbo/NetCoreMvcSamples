### Branch/Project History

1. [feature/htmlCssBasics](https://github.com/justin-capalbo/NetCoreMvcSamples/tree/feature/htmlCssBasics) HTML and CSS foundation.  Naive styling with limited CSS.  No jQuery, bootstrap, or client side framework.
2. [feature/javascriptBasics](https://github.com/justin-capalbo/NetCoreMvcSamples/tree/feature/javascriptBasics) Adding jQuery and Bootstrap as dependencies and manipulate page elements using both toolsets.
3. [feature/usingMvc](https://github.com/justin-capalbo/NetCoreMvcSamples/tree/feature/usingMvc) Implementing basic MVC6 routing, controllers, Razor Layout and Include, and a mail service.
4. [feature/usingBootstrap](https://github.com/justin-capalbo/NetCoreMvcSamples/tree/feature/usingBootstrap) Adding Twitter Bootstrap and jQuery capability to the project to style page elements and _bootstrappify_ the layout.
5. [feature/addingEfCore](https://github.com/justin-capalbo/NetCoreMvcSamples/tree/feature/addingEfCore) First look at implementing Entity Framework Core with MSSQL Server localdb.  Adds entities, migrations, and a repository pattern that is used by a new controller.
6. [feature/AspnetMvcApi](https://github.com/justin-capalbo/NetCoreMvcSamples/tree/feature/AspnetMvcApi) Here we've added controllers with RESTful verbs only, and no views.  These controllers act as data access APIs for performing CRUD operations on our data.
7. [feature/aspnetCoreIdentity](https://github.com/justin-capalbo/NetCoreMvcSamples/tree/feature/aspnetCoreIdentity) Adding authentication and authorization to our StoreUser.  Enforce through both a cookie scheme for the site and a JWT creation endpoint to obtain a valid token for API calls.
7. [feature/typescriptIntro](https://github.com/justin-capalbo/NetCoreMvcSamples/tree/feature/typescriptIntro) Adding typescript config and a few basic .ts files to play around with.
